1. Firstly created the model for books in the models folder
2. Creating the BookRepo in the repository folder
- Inside the book repository it only defines the methods to save the books data.(Abstraction)
- So inorder to do that we should create an interface to define its methods.

# How the request work the clean architecture

- Firstly the user sends an http request /posts then it will move to the sepcified controller
- In this controller (Services is dependent to the controller) it gets the data from the request body
and then passes the data to the services.(which is in usescases) It takes care about the data validation
and then it is called to the repositories where the method called by services is defined.
- The methods will be onliy defined inside the repository file, Its implementation will be inside the database

=> Inorder to do these we should initialize these:
- bookRepo := &database.BookeRepository{DB:db}
- bookService := &usecases.BookService{BookRepo:bookRepo}
- bookController := &controller.BookController{BookService:bookService}
